## Pioneer DJ Dave Smith Instruments TORAIZ AS-1 MIDI cheat sheet &amp; sound packs

The TORAIZ AS-1 is an analog monosynth with full digital control, designed by Dave Smith Instruments for Pioneer DJ. 

The synthesis engine and signal path are entirely analog, except for an optional digital multi FX. In essence, it offers a single voice from the Prophet-6, housed in an enclosure with a form factor reminiscent of a famous silver box.
